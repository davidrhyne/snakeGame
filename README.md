# snakeGame
This is a project that is part of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path.  We were encouraged to make this our own and this is my first attempt at achieving that goal.

Here are some of the enhancements:
* drop down box to pick a gameboard size
* dynamically sizing the gameboard when changed
* a texture of the snake

Thank you to scrimba for the excellent guidance that I have received, and for the inspiration to make projects like these.

And thank you to Hero Patterns for the texture used for the snake.
