# snakeGame
This is a project that is part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.  

https://davidrhyne.github.io/snakeGame/

We are encouraged to make these projects our own, and this is my first attempt at achieving that goal.  I plan to make further additions to the game, like adding high score board, but I wanted to get back to my studies.

Here are some of the enhancements:
* drop down box to pick a gameboard size
* dynamically sizing the gameboard when changed
* a texture of the snake

Thank you to scrimba for the excellent guidance and for the inspiration to make projects like these.

And thank you to Hero Patterns for the texture used for the snake.
